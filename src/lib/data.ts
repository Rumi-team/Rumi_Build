// ── Cal.com event types, one per call length ─────────────────────────────────
//
// EVERY PART OF THESE SLUGS IS A CAL.COM DASHBOARD SETTING, NOT A CONSTANT, AND
// CAL.COM DOES NOT REDIRECT WHAT IT RENAMES. This bit twice on 2026-08-05:
// first the account username went `rumi-app` -> `rumi-ai`, then the event type
// `30-min-meeting` was replaced by the two below. Both times the old URL began
// answering 404 the instant it was saved, and both times the page that broke
// was /book/success — the one a customer reaches AFTER their card is charged.
// They pay, land on "One last step — pick your time", and get an empty box.
//
// Nothing offline can catch the next one: a slug is just a string until someone
// requests it, and only cal.com knows if it still resolves. So if a booking
// calendar is ever empty, check these against the dashboard FIRST.
// Annotated `string` rather than left to infer their literal types. "" is a
// meaningful state these carry — it is what /book/success reads as "no calendar
// of this length exists, email the buyer times instead" — and a literal type
// makes that branch unreachable to TypeScript, so the tests that pin it stop
// compiling. The values are config, not constants; the type should say so.
export const CAL_LINK: string = "rumi-ai/call-30min";
export const CAL_LINK_60MIN: string = "rumi-ai/discovery-call-60min";

// Derived, never written out twice. These used to be independent literals, and
// a rename that fixed one and missed the other would send the inline embed and
// the "open in a new tab" link to two different calendars.
export const CALENDLY_URL: string = `https://cal.com/${CAL_LINK}`;
export const CALENDLY_URL_60MIN: string = CAL_LINK_60MIN
  ? `https://cal.com/${CAL_LINK_60MIN}`
  : "";

// WHY THE 60-MINUTE SLUG IS NO LONGER READ FROM NEXT_PUBLIC_CAL_LINK_60MIN.
// It was env-sourced for one reason: the event type did not exist, so "" was
// the honest value and the signal /book/success used to email times instead of
// handing a 60-minute buyer a 30-minute calendar. The event exists now, so that
// reason is gone — and the env var bought nothing anyway. `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` is
// inlined at BUILD time, so changing it still required a redeploy; it was never
// the faster fix it looked like. Here it is version-controlled, reviewable, and
// covered by tests/unit/cal-link.test.ts. The "" branch that drove the
// email-you-times fallback is still live code — see /book/success — it just has
// no configuration that reaches it today.

// TONE RULE (non-negotiable, applies to every string below):
// price the WORK, never the person. "~$3,000/mo of front-desk work" is correct;
// "a ~$3,000/mo receptionist" is not. No role ever "replaces" anyone and no
// human job title is ever named as the thing being cut. These roles absorb the
// repetitive work so the people stay on the work that needs a person.
//
// Pricing is always "from"/"starting at" — never a bare fixed number.

/**
 * Short pill shown beside a price. The headline number of the whole offer.
 * The label names its comparator — what that work costs to hire today — on
 * purpose: a bare "90% off" reads as a discount off a former Rumi price, which
 * is not the claim and would be misleading.

Month to month, no setup fee, and you can add or drop a role as the workload moves.";

// ── THIS MODULE IS IN THE CLIENT BUNDLE ──
// src/components/footer.tsx is a client component and imports AI_EMPLOYEES and
// VERTICALS to build its link columns, so everything reachable from those two
// arrays is compiled into the browser bundle on EVERY route — the footer renders
// on every page. Keep both arrays down to what a card, a nav link or a piece of
// metadata renders.
//
// The long-form prose that only the detail pages render lives in two server-only
// modules — src/lib/ai-employee-details.ts and src/lib/vertical-details.ts —
// imported by src/app/services/[slug]/page.tsx and the industries pages
// respectively. NEVER import either of them from this file: the footer reaches
// this module, so an import here puts all of that prose straight back on every
// page. A derived projection would not help either; the split works because the
// data physically lives elsewhere.
