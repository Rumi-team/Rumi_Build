// ── Why this file exists ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// On 2026-08-05 the Cal.com profile username was renamed from `rumi-app` to
// `rumi-ai` in the Cal.com dashboard. Cal.com does not redirect the old handle,
// so https://cal.com/rumi-app/30-min-meeting started answering 404 the instant
// it changed — and CAL_LINK, a string in this repo, still said `rumi-app`.
//
// The page that broke is /book/success: the one a customer sees AFTER their
// card has been charged. They paid, landed on "One last step — pick your time",
// and the calendar had nothing to render.
//
// NOTHING HERE CAN CATCH THAT, and it is worth being honest about why: the
// username half of this slug lives in someone else's dashboard, and no offline
// assertion can know it was renamed. Only a live request to cal.com can, and
// this suite does not make network calls.
//
// What these cases DO catch is the class of mistake that made the rename worse
// than it had to be: two independent literals holding the same slug, so a fix
// applied to one and missed on the other sends the inline embed and the
// open-in-a-new-tab link to different calendars. CALENDLY_URL is derived from
// CAL_LINK now, and the first case is what stops anyone un-deriving it.

 * CAL_LINK_60MIN (a full URL, an extra path segment, an uppercase character)
 * would have stayed green and reached CalEmbed after a $125 purchase. The
 * more expensive of the two products had the weaker guard.
 *
 * Filtered because "" is a supported state for a length with no event type;
 * every caller re-guards the filtered length, because a filter that empties
 * silently turns its case into zero assertions (TESTING.md, "guard the walkers").
